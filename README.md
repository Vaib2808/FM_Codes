# FM_Codes
The Title of this project is FM_Codes 

The files in this are the answers to the questions given to Solve

All questions have been solved 

answer for Every question is in a different file

For example the code for Q1 is named as FMQ1.c 

Each answer to the questions is given in the above format to make it easily accessible 

All the code was written using VS Code 

I am not sure what the files without .c at the end are for, while i was writing the code on VS code after running the code it would always show up 
and it automatically came on github Desktop

So please ignore all files name FMQ1......FMQ10 the files without .c at end
